    <p> welcome to my page! </p>

    <p>
      Let me walk you through the journey of how I became a software/web developer
    </p>

    <p>
      It all began after first being introduced to coding by my roommates in college; where I saw firsthand how coding really was. I saw the endless possibilities and I began doing my own research and discovered the wonderful world of code!
